      <p class="project-item-paragraph">The Artificially Intelligent Virtual Assistant, or AIVA, is an AI that I have been independently developing to replicate JARVIS from Iron Man. As I learn more about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning, I have slowly added more integrations into AIVA to make her as functional as possible. Currently, AIVA is a fully-functional virtual assistant that understands speech and can respond using a text-to-speech algorithm. It is currently able to answer common &quot;What is...?&quot; questions and solve mathematical problems as complex as humans can describe them.<br><br>This project is undoubtedly my largest undertaking in the field of computer science. This project will continue to be a work in progress throughout my undergraduate career and will be the focus of my senior capstone project in artificial intelligence.<br><br><em>Languages Used: Python</em><br></p>

      <h3 class="heading-2">Taking the Number One Video Game to the Next Level.</h3>
      <p class="project-item-paragraph">Minecraft Plugin Development has become wildly popular since 2020, where players are making new additions and modifications to the game by implementing &quot;plugins&quot;. These plugins modify traditional (vanilla) gameplay by tracking random events that happen in-game and hijacking the primary source code to make it do something else. This provides users with limitless opportunities on changing the game, either to make it harder, easier, or just a more tailored experience to how they want to play.<br><br>I have used plugins to make various gamemodes that control how Minecraft is played, including &quot;Death Swap&quot;, &quot;Block Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Minecraft Manhunt&quot;, and more. As I continue to learn more about the Spigot API, the API controlling plugin development, I plan to make more complex gamemodes that show off the full capability of the API.<br><br><em>Languages Used: Java</em><br></p>

      <p class="project-item-paragraph">The Billboard Guessing Game was my first experience with web scraping and creating a &quot;full stack&quot; project. I created this project in my first semester coding, where I used BeautifulSoup to scrap the Billboard Hot 100 website to get the list of the Top 100 songs for the week. The user is then provided three random songs and then is tasked with guessing the order of the songs in the charts.<br><br>This project uses a lot of PyQT for front-end development, as I did not know HTML/CSS/JS when I created this project. If I were to do this project again, I would use ReactJS to make a fully responsive website that had more visual effects and is more visually appealing. However, for my first real project, I am very proud of the results.<br><br><em>Languages Used: Python</em><br></p>

      <h3 class="heading-2">An AI to solve today&#x27;s most popular word game.</h3>
      <p class="project-item-paragraph">The goal of this project was to create an automated solution that solved the daily Wordle puzzle in the shortest amount of guesses. The goal was to find optimal words that provide the most amount of information, and then use this to make logical guesses that narrow down the most words with each guess. The average number of guesses it takes the Wordle solver is currently 3.4, but I hope to decrease this average using smarter selection and a stronger predictive algorithm.<br><br>The Javascript code behind wordle helps to provide more details into the valid words that can be guessed, which provides the basis as to the database of words to use. From the code, we can actually extrapolate the word of the day based on the founding date of Wordle and the word database, meaning that the AI can get it in 1 guess each time. However, it takes 3.4 (and lowering!) when using the predictive algorithm.<br><br><em>Languages Used: C++</em><br></p>

      <p class="project-item-paragraph">The aim of this project was to build a full curriculum companion that supported Suncoast High School&#x27;s Jumpstart Program.  The Jumpstart Program was founded as an initiative to bridge the gap between middle-school mathematics and the rigorous standards of Suncoast&#x27;s mathematics courses. Most incoming freshmen at Suncoast take Algebra II virtually to get ahead of the curriculum standard, which has led to statistically significant lapses in information that has hindered their success in the Program.<br><br>This book was written to contain all the contents of the program, including further resources, worked out examples, and practice exercises that the students can use to practice. This book was designed so that the instructors of the Program can also reference it easily and guide students through using the book. All four individuals that worked on this project attended the Jumpstart Program every year of high school; the first year as students and the last three as instructors. Publishing this book is in progress.<br><br><em>Languages Used: LaTeX</em><br></p>
