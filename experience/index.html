      <p>I currently work as a beta software tester and developer for Apple. Apple provides developers the opportunity to be self-employed as a beta tester and developer, where Apple pre-releases future updates to their beta developers to use, find errors, and solve problems in the software. This is not a paid position, but I do have the opportunity to work as much as I want on making the software better. I work primarily on testing and developing iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS and work about ten hours a week making these operating systems better.<br><br>This opportunity both combines my skills in coding, debugging, and problem-solving with giving back to the community and making noticeable change. It is quite humbling to notice that changes that you designed and made are visible in public update releases. The combination of volunteerism with computer science makes this opportunity so valuable to my development as a computer scientist.<br><br><em>Languages Used: Swift</em></p>

          <p>As an independently-contracted escape room designer, I have the opportunity to tap into my creative side and build escape rooms. I completed my first escape room in 2017 and have done dozens all around the country. After receiving my first escape room job working as a game master, I made it my mission to learn how to build an escape room myself and get contracted to build one. I found a new escape room company in my hometown and offered my services and he (somewhat hesitantly) accepted my offer.<br><br>I went to work and built the Stranger Things escape room (right image). I used the full stack to create all the visual effects and front-end design, the backend workings and flow of the room, and a proprietary control system that provides full control of all mechanisms from an app.<br><br>Since then, I have been contracted to complete three escape rooms for this company. In the future, I hope to find more companies to design escape rooms for, as well as make more intricate designs to provide a more immersive experience.<br><br><em>Languages Used: Assembly, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript<br>Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Intel Quartus, ReactJS</em></p>

          <p class="paragraph">Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps, or NROTC, is an opportunity like no other. The NROTC Program is a program designed to educate and prepare students for future service as military officers. NROTC is an opportunity to develop &quot;midshipmen&quot; (the rank given to students enrolled in the NROTC program) morally, mentally, and physically to become future leaders of the U.S. military.<br><br>Through various evolutions throughout the year, midshipmen are pushed to their limits in physical fitness, leadership, and teamwork. Summer training evolutions allow for midshipmen to apply skills they learn in the classroom and at battalion events in the fleet, as well as learn about life in active duty service.<br><br>NROTC has played a large role in developing me into the leader that I am today. It has imbued in me a passion for service and a vision that goes far beyond what meets the eye. NROTC has sculpted me by testing my mental fortitude through challenging times, my organization skills by combining the rigor of Vanderbilt academics and the challenge of balancing NROTC with extracurricular activities, and my ability to work as as team and a family to accomplish the mission.<br><br>Through serving in various billets, including Academics Officer and Platoon Commander, I have also had the chance to give back to the battalion by using my skillset to help others and further develop the midshipmen inside the battalion.<br></p>
